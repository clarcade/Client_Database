Client_Database
===============

I undertook this for a client (who wishes to remain anonymous for security purposes) pro-bono. This database represents a business that has members, interests, usernames/passwords, and contact information (addresses, etc.). I created and seeded this database and employed primary/foreign/unique keys.
